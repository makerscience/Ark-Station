You went to sleep dreaming of a new world. You woke to the violent screams of tearing metal and the howl of decompression. The hull has been breached. 

Helpless, you watch as hundreds of bodies are ripped from their stasis pods and flung into the vast darkness of space beyond. With seconds to spare, you claw your way free, slamming the emergency manual override as the air is sucked from your lungs. The breach seals. You survive. But the crew is all dead and you lack the command authorization to open any of the remaining pods.  

Ahead lies your destination. Closer than you expected. Ark station is only a few days away. It is meant to be your sanctuary, a foothold in a new solar system, built by machines before you even arrived. But as the Ark Ship draws closer, your hope sours. 

The station is a ruin, drifting perilously close to the burning star it orbits. There is no welcome beacon. No hail from the automatic systems. You dock with the silent hulk, stepping into a graveyard of cold, dark corridors. 

The heart of the station--the reactor--is dead. Thousands of colonists remain trapped in stasis, unaware their time is running out. Backup life support is failing. First hundreds will die, then thousands. 

You stand before the silent reactor. It has to start, or everyone is going to die here.
