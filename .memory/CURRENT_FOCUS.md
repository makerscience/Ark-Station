# CURRENT_FOCUS

## One-liner
- Ark Station: A crisis management survival game - maintain governance-only memory for Claude Code sessions.

## Active Objectives (max 3)
1. Continue development of Ark Station game
2. Playtest and balance gameplay

## Next Actions
- [ ] Playtest full game loop from intro to victory/defeat
- [ ] Balance decay/repair rates if game feels too fast or slow
- [ ] Add scientific names for shield repair upgrades (currently placeholders)
- [ ] Add more variety to ending messages based on victory conditions
- [ ] Consider individual drone assignment system (explored but deferred)

## Open Loops / Blockers
- Shield repair upgrades have placeholder names ("Solar Shield: Repair Enhancement I/II/III")
- Display power cost for solar/orbital panels not implemented

## How to Resume in 30 Seconds

- **If unclear:** Run "Follow the Session Start Protocol"

## Last Session Summary (max ~8 bullets)
- Converted thrusters from single integrity-based system to 4 individual toggle units
- Each thruster: unlocked via research, consumes 1 power when ON, binary state (no repair)
- Research: "Orbital Thrusters" unlocks panel+T1, then T2/T3/T4 as separate upgrades
- Removed thrusters from drone repair targets (now only Reactor, Stasis, Shield)
- 4 active thrusters fully counter orbital decay (each contributes 0.001 vs 0.00334 base decay)
- New UI: horizontal grid of 4 smaller thruster graphics with toggle buttons
- Cleaned up old thruster CSS and removed MAX_THRUSTER_POWER constant
