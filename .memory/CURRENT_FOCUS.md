# CURRENT_FOCUS

## One-liner
- Ark Station: A crisis management survival game - maintain governance-only memory for Claude Code sessions.

## Active Objectives (max 3)
1. Continue development of Ark Station game
2. Playtest and balance gameplay

## Next Actions
- [ ] Playtest full game loop from intro to victory/defeat
- [ ] Balance decay/repair rates if game feels too fast or slow
- [ ] Add scientific names for shield repair upgrades (currently placeholders)
- [ ] Add more variety to ending messages based on victory conditions
- [ ] Consider individual drone assignment system (explored but deferred)

## Open Loops / Blockers
- Shield repair upgrades have placeholder names ("Solar Shield: Repair Enhancement I/II/III")
- Display power cost for solar/orbital panels not implemented

## How to Resume in 30 Seconds

## Last Session Summary (max ~8 bullets)
- Reactor display now shows available power (decreases as allocated) instead of allocated power
- Renamed stasis bay upgrades with scientific names (Atmospheric Blend Controller, etc.)
- Renamed reactor core upgrades with scientific names (Muon-Catalyzed Ignition Lattice, etc.)
- Reworked shield: starts at 3% integrity, 100% max, upgrades boost repair speed instead of integrity
- Solar/Shield and Orbital/Thrusters now unlock independently (can research in any order)
- Shifted stasis bay upgrades down one Command Authorization level
- Reactor power scaling: 1 power per 5% integrity (max 20, was 25), fixed initial power to 4
- Added consistent green ONLINE / red OFFLINE headers for all systems
