## Active Objectives (max 3)
1. Continue development of Ark Station game
2. Playtest and balance gameplay

## Next Actions
- [ ] Playtest full game loop from intro to victory/defeat
- [ ] Balance decay/repair rates if game feels too fast or slow
- [ ] Add scientific names for shield repair upgrades (currently placeholders)
- [ ] Add more variety to ending messages based on victory conditions
- [ ] Consider individual drone assignment system (explored but deferred)

## Open Loops / Blockers
- Shield repair upgrades have placeholder names ("Solar Shield: Repair Enhancement I/II/III")
- Display power cost for solar/orbital panels not implemented

## Last Session Summary (max ~8 bullets)
- Implemented tiered shield absorption for solar flares (replaces power-based reduction)
  - 8 tiers from 100% absorption (85%+ integrity) down to 0% (shield destroyed)
  - Shield takes flare damage first, then absorption calculated
- Removed old flareReduction calculation (was power × integrity × effectiveness)
- Added `getShieldAbsorption()` helper function at line 4185
