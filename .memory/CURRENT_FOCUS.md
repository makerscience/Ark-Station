## Last Session Summary (max ~8 bullets)
- Converted thrusters to 4 individual toggle units (unlocked separately, 1 power each, no repair)
- New thruster UI: horizontal grid with per-unit status (LOCKED/OFF/ON) and flame animations
- Removed thrusters from drone repair targets (now only Reactor, Stasis, Shield)
- Added solar flare visual effect: red tint overlay + screen shake based on shield power
  - Full shield = no disruption; no shield = max tint + heavy shake
- Fixed research modal scroll position (now resets to top when opened)
- Fixed thruster toggle cursor (was showing not-allowed when ON)
